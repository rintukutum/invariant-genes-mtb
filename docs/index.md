# Overview
This is a website contains details about `dataset` and `methodology` adopted for searching invariant
proteins across 1623 *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* clinical isolates.

## Datasets
### 1623 M. tb clinical isolates
Raw variant calling files `.vcf` of 1623 *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
clinical isolates, was downloaded from [GMTV database](http://mtb.dobzhanskycenter.org/). The downloaded variation file used
in our analysis is [available here] `[225 MB]`. The details on 1623 *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* clinical isolates can be downloaded from [here] `[464 KB]`.

### 890 Metabolic genes
From our previously published article \[[1]\] , 890 metabolic genes (RvIDs) were queried against downloaded variation file. The refernce genome of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* H37Rv (NC000962.3) was downloaded from [NCBI].

## Methodology of invariant genes

The detail methodology will be available soon with our article under communication.

## Additional `.vif` files
Variation information file `.vif` was generated using the reference
genome and GMTV variation file for 890 metabolic genes. The zipped file
is avaliable [here](https://goo.gl/thOjSm) `[2 MB]`.
